				b. Maintaining Software
				c. Deploying Software--------------- to Eniviornment----Testing Env.
											Production env.



	Examples of Software:
			1.Zoom  Software ( Application Software)
			Server product 
						 
				Thick Servers
				( online servies)
				( for zoom meetings, etc.)
			Client product ( product help to connect online services)

			2.Chrome Browser ( Thin client Software)
					Cross platform Browser
					Platform independent Browser
					platform neutral Browser
					Accessing remote website
						  Send HTTP request to remote web site
						  Recive HTTP response from remote web site
						  Render the response in the form Presentation

							Thick and Thin:
							Depends on functionality being executed


			Thick Client Software
				word , power point , Excel--------
					save file,
					create documents
				        format existing documents
					Search contents in document
							
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
					
 Where is the location of software  deployed ?
		Client Software Single User Softare

		 (Stand alone Application) 
			(Monolithic Application) ( complete functionality in one process)
			(Desktopp Application)
			Browser----------chrome.exe (Exeuctable file for windows) (Thin client)
			word-------------winword.exe (Exeuctable file for windows) (Thick Client)

			excel, mspaint, postman ------Windows Application (GUI )
						 ( UI Logic, Core Business Logic, Data Access Logic)
			postman ------Windows Application (GUI )
					(.exe and set of dll files)
		
				
		Server Software	
				( Multi User Software)
				( or Multile server (Cluster))
						(Contiously running)
						1.Keep listening on port no for client requests
						{
						2.receive request
						3.maintain session for each connected User
							tarck session, manage session
						4.Dispatching (routing) incomming request to handler
						
						5.process request
						6.Fetch data from external data source
						7.Apply core business Logic
						8.format response
						9.Send response
						}
