Case Study:
A movie Theater "XYZ Cinemas" is looking to build a digital channel for allowing thier customers to book their movie tickets online.

	look at Payment

ticket payment so that is a theme and
payments they can be multiple epic 
	Cash Payment			Online Payment



The cash payment so customer goes to the online app they select the seat and book the seat but they want to pay it in cash when they kind of pick up the tickets so that can be that can be one of the requirement so cash payment so; ability for the customers to pay after booking it once this you know kind of szeliga take the tickets at the ticket counter so this kind of this requirement which will help to improve the app adoption and if the customers are not you know using very used using online payments so this is one of the feature which will help them to use the app and then you know go on from there the second one was on we went epic so here the requirement is the customer selects the seeds block you know books etiquettes and then when they cut they want to pay in the payment in the online app itself they don't want to come and stand the counter again and then make the payment so this is the epic which will have the requirements for that online payment functionality again it's a high-level online payment can be further broken down which will which we will look in the in the third layer which is a user stories so the second uses second layer cash payment online payment again they are still linked to the ticket payments theme so this is how you can kind of form the traceability and we coming to the third layer which is the user story and it's a decomposition of the epic for online payment so again our multiple user stories again I listed two just for illustration one is the ability for the customers to make the payment using their internet banking portal so there should be a link from our app to the internet banking where the customers would be able to make their make the payment and the other user story would be can be like you know card payments again this can be further decomposed into a debit card credit card but I just kept it as card payment so this is where the customers can use their debit or credit cards to make the payment on the app of web app or the mobile app itself so this is our user story again these will be linked to the epic online payment as I stated earlier epic and user stories would be created by the product owner or the ba be supporting the product owner and they will be again kind of link back to the theme this would be again maintained by the product owner themselves or the BA can do it on behalf of the product owner but this kind of provides the traceability it can be maintained in an excel or it can be kind of tacked in Xero I'll come to the Xero just once I complete the complete this particular example and then the fourth layer once we have the epic carrot online payment and you know the user is linked internet banking car payment into the Sprint backlog then we would have the scrum team the developers are on the testing or the testers would be creating a task underneath the user story and link it to them so the task can be the development related task then testing related tasks so this is your fourth layer and as I was stating earlier if you have multiple developers working on a single task then it can be broken down into this fifth layer which is a sub task for example for court card payment they would be an API needed so that can be one sub task developing that API required and then we have to have a payment gateway integration so that's another sub task which needs to be done in order for the user story for card payments to be delivered so again this is a good exam one example I would say covering from the theme to the sub task similar activity can be done for other user stories and epics and you will have the full traceability so from a traceability prospective we have the RTM so this concept can be applied here we can have the theme on one side one column and then we can have the epics the link user stories the links tasks and linked sub tasks you know just from a traceability perspective but I think the most of this commonly used for tracking is zero so JIRA has all these kind of built in as an issue type so we have a issue type for epic creating an epic creating a user story creating a task creating a sub task all of these are there as an issue type in JIRA and it can be created and it can be kind of tagged in the subtasks can be linked to the task tasks and be linked to the user story users can be linked to the epic and for the theme again there are different ways to do this mapping one of the common ways using a label so if you use a label called ticket payment and link that to picks on these stories so if you do a filter just with that particular label you will be able to find out all the related requirements eye pics user stories link to that particular theme again it's very easy to visualize and also to help in the prioritization when you're talking up with the wider business stakeholders so again the green arrow indicates the teammate at the top and it comes down all the way to the subtasks so that's that's about it hopefully this example and this video would have given you the view of the differences and also how you would be able to articulate it to the interviewer using an example so you can use an example any example from the project which you've worked on so that would be more you know real and you will have much more details which can be covered in case if the interviewer asks for the probing questions which brings us to the end
