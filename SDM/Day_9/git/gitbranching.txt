Branching

Branching means you diverge from the main line of dev-elopment and continue to do work without messing with that main line. In many VCS (Version Control System) tools, this is a somewhat expensive process, often requiring you to create a new copy of your source code directory, which can take a long time for large projects.

To create a new branch and switch to it at the same time, you can run the git checkout command with the -b switch:

$ git checkout -b iss53

This is shorthand for:

$ git branch iss53
$ git checkout iss53



$ git commit -a -m 'Create new footer [issue 53]'

$ git checkout master
$ git checkout -b hotfix

$ git checkout master
$ git merge hotfix


git branch -d hotfix

After youâ€™ve done all these tasks, and are certain the main branch performs just as the master branch, you can delete the master branch:

$ git push origin --delete master
