Good Morning :))

 linux topmost folder  = /
  ~   =  user login folder
  pwd = shows the current folder  
  
  cd /  = change current folder to topmost 
  cd ..  = change current folder to parent folder 
  mkdir ../ex1/ex2   = 
  
  remove a folder that is empty = rmdir  folder-path
  remove a folder that is non-empty = 
  	  rm -r folderpath
  	  rm = command
  	  -r  = option , recursively remove all 		subfolders
  
  How to create a file on terminal ?
    touch filepath  = it creates a 0kb file
    
  How to see detail listing of folder content ?
      ls -l
      
  How to open a command line editor in linux terminal?
     gedit = GUI editor
     vi  = vi editor - famous command line editor 
    
      vi  filepath
        to enter - change mode to INSERT mode
        	   by pressing   i  
        to enter on a new line - press o
           
        to save - change mode to COMMAND mode
        		by pressing esc key
        	type  :w  = save only
        	type :q  = exit saved file
        	type :wq  = exit and save 
        	type :q! = exit without saving
        	type 3dd = delete 3 lines
        	type p = paste the content of clipboard wherever the cursor
        	type 2yy  = to copy 2 lines
        yy = yanking = copying to clipboard
        	
        	   
    
    
    to see the contents of a file ?  cat  filepath

   Segmentation /Paging / 
  
   Paged Segmentation
   	process is divided into SEGMENTS
   		EACH segment is divided into PAGES
   	RAM is divided into Frames
   		and pages are loaded in the FRAME
   		
   For every segment a different page table
   
   ________________________________________
   
   
   Demand Paging / Virtual memory management technique
   
   --  partial process is loaded in RAM 
   --- on non consecutive locations 
   
   Advantage 
   	--- process greater than RAM size can be executed
   	---  unnecessary loading is avoided
   	--- degree of multiprogramming IMPROVES
   	number of process present in the RAM at a time
   		this number increases
   
  _____________________
  
  Virtual memory  = Swap space , part of the hard disk that holds the remaining pages of the process
  
  
  Partial process in loaded in RAM  = forx 10% of total pages  
   P1 that has 100 pages
   Pages loaded in RAM = 10 
   Remaining pages on virtual memory/swap space = 90
   
 Page table is created for 10 pages
 
 --- Program starts
 ---  f1()   Jump to Page 23 ,offset 8
 ---   As only 10 pages are in RAM -- page 23 not present ---- interrupt occurs = PAGE FAULT INTERRUPT
 --- IST of Page fault interrupt will RUN
 	*it will load the DEMANDED PAGE in a free frame
 	*add the page entry in page table
 	* move the process to ready state
 	 
  As pages are loaded on demand hence called as DEMAND PAGING  !!!
   
   What if ??? PAGE FAULT occurs and no free frame present  ????  PAGE  REPLACEMENT will be done
   
   Page replacement -- replace existing page in a frame with demanded page!!
   WHICH page should be replaced ??
   	depends on Page replacement algorithm used in the Kernel  !!!
   	
   	Common Page Replacement Algorithms ---
   	1. FIFO =  every page is tagged with arrival time , the page with earlies arrival is removed first.
   	
   	2. OPT = optimal page replacement algorithm
   replace that page which will not be needed again 
   		THERORETICAL !!
   		
     a. LRU = replace the page that is NOT used for a long time .LEAST RECENTLY USED
     
     
     b. MRU = Most recently used= replace the page that is used just now 
     
 ------------------
 Page access string =  1,3,2,1,4,5,3,4
  find the number of page faults and page replacements if the RAM is 3 frames  
  use FIFO
  use LRU 
  use MRU 
  
  HW  -- Page access string = 1,2,3,4,1,2,1,4,5
  find the number of page faults and page replacements if the RAM is 4 frames  
  use FIFO
  use LRU 
  use MRU 
 
 _____________________________________
 Page replacement Policy ----
 	1. Global Page Replacement Policy= If there is a page fault in P1 , the page of p6 may get replaced
 	disadvantage --- THRASHING problem that many processes may start faulting as their pages are replaced , systems hangs
 	
 	Solution to THRASHING -- 2 Local page replacement policy - If there is a page fault in P1 then another page of p1 is replaced.

 File Handling Commands  ----
   clear , pwd, ls, ls -l , cd , mkdir, rmdir, rm -r , rm , touch , vi , cat  
   
 Bash commands ----  Bash is the Linux SHELL program
 
 CLI  = shell program
 	  it takes command as input and gives result as output 
  
  Linux has many shells --- 
  	default shell = bash shell
  	 k shell, c shell , TCSH  ,.....
  	
  	every shell has a different command set !!!
  	
   x=10  creates a variable
   echo $x   prints value 
   export PS1="\u\h\w >>>"   change the Prompt string
