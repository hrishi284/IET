Good Morning :)

  C program in linux .
  
    /home/iet/commands/hello.c 
    		===>gcc
    		===>/home/iet/a.out
    		
    a.out is the executable file
    
 To create output executable file with other name and path.use -o option
 
    gcc -o ./commands/hello ./commands/hello.c
 _________________________________________________
 Shell -- program for CLI
 Default Shell program--- Bash
 
 Where is the executable of bash ?  /bin
  
 Variables  --- normal variables
 OR
 Environment variables ---variables are used by all programs in the system including kernel programs
 
   PATH = this env variable gives a list of folder paths that may have the executable program
   
   
 How to see a variable value ? 
 	using a meta character = $varname
 	
  How to change the value of environment variable ?
      export PATH=""
      export PS1="\W >>"
      
   To see most of the environment variables --
   	 type env
   	 
  _______________________________
  What is shell scripting ?
  
  	shell = bash command set
script = program = set of instructions(commands)

shell script = program written using BASH commands 

bash acts as an interpreter = to translate and run the shell script .

   ls -a  }  show all files including hidden files
   		files starting with . are hidden


1. Write a shell script that prints hello world.	
  	vi  first.sh  -- to type the code
  	bash first.sh -- to run the code
  	
  	use echo 
  	use echo  -n  (stops new line )
  	
   sudo apt install vim
    vim first.sh
    
 ______________________
 
  read command = get input from user kbd
  
  2. write a shellscript that will accept a name from user and print it 
  
 ____________________________
 
 3. write a shellscript to accept a folder name from the user 
 	in the current folder,create that folder
 	show its detail 
 	
 4. write a shellscript to accept a filename from the user create a file of 0kb in the parent folder

 Process Management 
 
 process, PCB -- process Id
 
 What is the command to see the processes on our system ?
    ps  - pid , tty = terminal where the process was created, time , cmd =program
 
 command tty = terminal type = ID of the terminal
 command man ps   ( quit :q )
 
 	ps -e  [ show active processes on entire system
 
   command kill pid [ kill a process with given pid 
   
     ps -e -f   [ -f option for full details 
     OR
     ps -ef
     
     To see a few columns use -o 
     ps -e -o pid,ppid,cmd
     
     PPID = parent process Id
     PPID 1 = init process
     
    IF we want to create a child process from our C program , how to do it ?  fork system call
    
    What is a system call ?
       calling the function of the kernel 
       
    If you want to make a system call ?
     	header file name, name of function, parameters
     	return value
    Linux man pages  
     
  1. getpid 
  2. getppid   
     
     number of processes created will be
     2 raised to number of forks
